# touchSnakes
A little game for mobile phone or tablet where users try to block others

## Play

https://restimel.github.io/touchSnakes/index.html

_(it won't work on classic desktop, as you need a touch device)_

### How to play

Touch the screen. Several players play on the same screen (limitation depends of your device).

Then move your finger to move your snake. It grows longer depending of the distance you have run.

If any snake hit another one (or itself), it dies.
Idle snake also dies.

The last snake alive is the winner.

## Technology

This game has been made only with vanilla JavaScript (with ES6 features). It uses touch event properties.


## Improvement

It is a one day game. So there must be lot of cool stuff to add. I will probably add somes but if you want to contribute feel free to do it and send me your great work!
